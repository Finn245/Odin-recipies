    <h1>description</h1>
    a flat, open-faced baked pie of Italian origin, consisting of a thin layer of bread dough topped with spiced tomato sauce and cheese, often garnished with anchovies, sausage slices, mushrooms, etc.
    <h1>ingredients</h1>
    <ul>
        <li>Onion</li>
        <li>Bell pepper</li>
        <li>All-purpose Flour</li>
        <li>Sugar</li>
        <li>Salt</li>
        <li>Flour</li>
        <li>Tomato sauce</li>
        <li>Olive oil</li>
        <li>Mozzarella</li>
    </ul>
    <h1>Steps</h1>
    <ol>
        <li>Make your own dough. Mix it up in the morning (or the night before) and it will be waiting for you come dinnertime.</li>
        <li>Keep the sauce and toppings simple. A simple, no-cook red sauce is best. To ensure the crust cooks through, keep the toppings to just a handful.</li>
        <li>Bake it hot. Crank the oven to its highest setting and let it heat for at least half an hour. Then, bake the pizza on parchment paper (either on a pizza stone or baking sheet) for about 10 minutes.</li>
    </ol>
